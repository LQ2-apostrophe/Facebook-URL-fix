## How does this extension work?
### 1. Removing unnecessary query parameters from Facebook URLs

For example, this URL points to a page that shows a reply to a comment on a post:
```
https://www.facebook.com/<somebody>/posts/<post_id>?ref=notif&notif_t=like&notif_id=<notif_id>&comment_id=<comment_id>&reply_comment_id=<reply_comment_id>
```
Unneeded query parameters: `ref, notif_t, notif_id`

New URL:
```
https://www.facebook.com/<somebody>/posts/<post_id>?comment_id=<comment_id>&reply_comment_id=<reply_comment_id>
```

### 2. Changing modern photo links into legacy links

This is one modern photo link used in Facebook pages:
```
https://www.facebook.com/<onepage>/photos/<album_id>/<photo_id>
```
It will be changed into this legacy shorter link:
```
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=<photo_id>
```

### 3. Shortening album ID containing `a.<something>` in query parameter `set` in legacy album links

(This feature is available since version 1.1.)

Here is a legacy link to a photo album:
```
https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.<minimal_numeric_part>.<extra_numeric_part_1>.<extra_numeric_part_2>
```
This will be changed into:
```
https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.<minimal_numeric_part>
```
